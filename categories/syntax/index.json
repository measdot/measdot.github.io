I’ve worked with startups for almost a decade in the Publishing, AdTech, Edtech, eSports \u0026amp; Fashion industries.\nA bit about me… While studying Computer Science, I was building servers in my hostel. Writing C, C++ \u0026amp; shell scripts were your essential toolbox to getting things to work!\nMy first industry job was for a small startup. Being a technology team of a few, meant exposure to diverse challenges \u0026amp; projects. Office \u0026amp; network support one day, robust application building the next. Code quality, automation \u0026amp; testing became crucial to juggling so much, with few resources. Those early roles gave me a taste of databases, and I became more and more involved with data stores of all kinds.\nFrom there I shifted to web development as a lot of opportunities were popping up.India’s startup ecosystem was growing at a rapid clip and I was able to parlay my communication \u0026amp; people skills to help them.\nWhat I’m big on… It’s my job to know how different technologies interact with each other. So any topic in the following areas tend to capture my attention:\n Datacenter evolution \u0026amp; virtualization Provisioning, deployments \u0026amp; automation (How to use Terraform) Web scalability \u0026amp; performance (5 things are toxic to scalability) Caching with elasticache \u0026amp; varnish (5 ways to cache websites) High availability (The Myth of 5 nines) Lean startups \u0026amp; agile methodology  I also enjoy the perfect cup of joe, extreme trekks and growing my network. Social Media, blogging and website analytics are like frosting on the cake!\nSo far… For past decade I\u0026rsquo;ve been helping global companies and start-ups with keep-it-simple approach.\n 2017 Lead DevOps @PipingRock 2015 Senior Software Engineer @Housejoy 2014 Web Developer @Eulogic 2010 Research Engineer @BRiCS  Here is what they say about my home town, Varanasi\n Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together.\n\n—  Mark Twain1 \n  The above quote is cited from Eck, D.
